/* 
Assuming one client and one server now.
In the final implementation, there will be more nodes and each node is both a client and a server (all-to-all communication pattern).
Step 1: send "Hello World" to the server
Step 2: make a Record Batch, send it to the server
Step 3: sort the Record Batch according to some criteria, send the second half to the server
