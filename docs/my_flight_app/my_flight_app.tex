\section{Introduction}
This report includes the design of a distributed sorting application which utilizes Apache Arrow Flight as the means of communication.
The experiments demonstrates the performance of the application.

\section{Design}
\subsection{Test data}
The final goal of designing this application is to integrate it into a genomic data process pipeline, where data in the SAM format
\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_(file_format)\#Format}} is sorted.

From the perspective of sorting, the most interesting fields are \texttt{RNAME} (the name of the references sequence) and \texttt{POS} (position.)
They together determine the order in which records are sorted.

Thus, to simplify the prototyping work, we design a data structure with three fields: \texttt{GROUP}, \texttt{SEQ}, and \texttt{DATA}.
Each record belongs to a group and has a sequence number in that group.
Its data is placed in the \texttt{DATA} field.

\subsection{Software components}

\begin{itemize}
    \item sorter
    \item sender
    \item receiver
    \item merger
    \item storage
\end{itemize}

The \textit{sorter} reads the records from text files into memory.
The goal of sorting is to put records in the ascending order: records with smaller Group IDs are placed before those with large Group IDs.
If the Group IDs of two records are the same, the secondary criteria is the sequence number.

The \textit{sorter} puts the sorted records into the \textit{storage}, where records belonging to other nodes will be retrieved and sent away by the \textit{sender}.

We use \textit{Plasma Object Store} as the means of storage.

\subsection{Building the project}

On macOS, the \texttt{grpc} library installed via \texttt{Homebrew} (as a dependency of \texttt{apache-arrow}) seems to be problematic.
The Flight server would incur a segmentation fault due to the current version (stable 1.26.0) of \texttt{grpc}.

We can make use of the existing build system of arrow to build \texttt{grpc} from source.
(The build system is capable of building any missing dependency from source.)
This also saves us from building missing dependencies manually on Cartesius.
